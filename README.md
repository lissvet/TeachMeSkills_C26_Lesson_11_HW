Homework for the eleventh lesson

**task0**  
We have written a program with the following functionality:  
A string (which is some standardized document number in a given format) is passed as input.  
The document number has the format xxxx-yyyy-xxxxx-yyyy-xyxyxyxyxyxyxy, where x is any digit and y is a letter of the Latin alphabet (can be a major or minor).  
        - Output the first two blocks of 4 digits on one line.  
        - Display the document number, but replace blocks of three letters with *** (each letter will be replaced by *).  
        - Display only one letter of the document number in the format yyy/yyy/yy/y/y/y/y in lower case.  
        - Display letters from the document number in the format "Letters:yyy/yyy/yy/y/y/y/y/y/y/y" in uppercase (implemented using StringBuilder class).  
        - Check if the document number contains the sequence "abc", and output a message if it does or not (abc and ABC are considered the same sequence).  
        - Check if the document number starts with the sequence 555.  
        - Check if the document number ends with the sequence 1a2b.  
All these methods are implemented in a separate class in static methods, each task in a separate method.  
The methods take as input (input parameter) a string entered into the program.  


**task1**  
A string of arbitrary length with arbitrary words is input.  
Find the shortest word in the string and display it on the screen.  
Find the longest word in the string and display it on the screen.  
If there are several such words, the last of them is displayed.  
(The code is added to display both words)

**task2**  
An arbitrary string is given.  
Output to the console a new string in which each letter of the initial string is duplicated. of the initial string.  
For example, "Hello" -> "HHeelllloo".
